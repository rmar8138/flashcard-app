# Flashcard App

## Statement of Purpose and Scope

Flashcard App is an application that builds decks of flashcards for users to use for study and review. Users create decks and fill them with cards, like any standard flashcard deck. These cards have a front and a back; the front holding the question and the back holding the answer. This will allow users to review any topic they wish straight from their command line!
